# Programming-an-electronic-circuit-that-contains-6-motors-of-the-servo-motor-type

Introduction: 

In this project, we will control six servo motors using six potentiometers with an Arduino board. Each potentiometer will adjust the position of a corresponding servo motor. This is a simple and effective way to understand the basics of analog input (from the potentiometers) and PWM output (to the servos) using an Arduino.

Components Needed:

1 x Arduino Uno
6 x Servo Motors
6 x Potentiometers
1 x Breadboard
Connecting wires

Circuit Diagram:
Refer to the provided image for the circuit diagram. Connect each potentiometer to the analog input pins A0 to A5 and each servo motor to the digital pins 7 to 12 on the Arduino. Ensure that you also connect the ground and power lines appropriately.
